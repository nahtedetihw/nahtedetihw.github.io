# MusicLyricsShare

## Long press lyrics in Apple Music to share them!

** iOS 14.5 introduced lyrics sharing by long pressing the lyrics line. MusicLyricsShare brings this to lower versions. Also works for static lyrics. You can long press the single line lyrics, or you can press the three dot button next to the song name and select view full lyrics and then long press the static lyrics to copy the full song lyrics. **
