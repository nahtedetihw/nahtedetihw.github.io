# NoButtonsWhenPlaying

## Remove the Quick Actions Buttons when playing music.

### NoButtonsWhenPlaying was only tested to work on iOS 13.


** The Quick Actions are the buttons on the Lockscreen for Camera or Flashlight. NoButtonsWhenPlaying removes the buttons when Music is playing and adds them back when Music is not playing. This was a tweak request on my Discord channel, if you aren't a part of that, here is the link: [https://discord.gg/64kVRNzKnF](https://discord.gg/64kVRNzKnF) **
