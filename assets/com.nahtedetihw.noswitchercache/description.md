# NoSwitcherCache

## Remove the cache of the snapshots when using a Grid Switcher.

### NoSwitcherCache was only tested to work on iOS 13.


** NoSwitcherCache is meant to be paired with another tweak that gives you the grid switcher on iphone, I reccommend iPadSwitcher by dpkg_ which can be found on Packix Repo. **

This was a tweak request on my Discord channel, if you aren't a part of that, here is the link: [https://discord.gg/64kVRNzKnF](https://discord.gg/64kVRNzKnF)
